# Team Caution: Virtual Pets

Welcome to the pet shelter! In this game, you play as a kindhearted soul, taking in animals that you find and helping them to find loving homes.

# Naming Your Shelter

- When you start a new game, the first thing you will be prompted to do is name your animal shelter. Name it whatever you want!

# Finding Pets

- When you find an abandoned animal, you will have the opportunity to choose whether the pet is ORGANIC or ROBOTIC. 
- ROBOTIC pets function differently than organic pets. 
- You will also be able to choose the pet's SPECIES, such as dog, cat, turtle, or elephant. The pet's SPECIES can be anything you can think of! 
- You will also be able to give the pet a NAME.

# Time

- As TIME passes, your pets will lose HEALTH and GAIN HUNGER and BOREDOM. 
- Every 15 seconds, a TICK happens. Every time the clock TICKS, your pets lose 5 HEALTH and gain 5 BOREDOM and HUNGER.

# Basic Needs

- BOREDOM is a measure of your pet's happiness, how satisfied they are in their life in your animal shelter. 
- HEALTH is a measure of your pet's well-being.
- HUNGER measures how much food they need!
- The MAXIMUM HEALTH, HUNGER, and BOREDOM is 100; the minimum is 0. 
- If BOREDOM or HUNGER reaches 100, or if HEALTH reaches 0, that's bad! 

# Interacting with your Pet

- FEEDING your pet makes them less hungry (HUNGER -40).
- Taking your pet to the DOCTOR will heal their sickness (HEALTH +30).
- PLAYING with your pet will make them happier and healthier (BOREDOM -20, HEALTH +10), but it will make them hungrier (HUNGER +10). 

# Robot Pets

- Robot pets behave differently than regular pets.
- Robot pets still have BOREDOM and HEALTH, but they don't get HUNGRY. Instead, you will need to periodically CHANGE THEIR OIL.
- Robot pets lose less health than organic pets. Instead of taking them to the doctor, you can hook your robot up to a CHARGER.
- While your robot pet is hooked up to a CHARGER, it cannot PLAY, but it regains 10 HEALTH per tick.

# Your Shelter

- Your SHELTER is where your pets are kept.
- While you are MANAGING your shelter, you can do several things.
- You can look at a LIST of all pets in your shelter.
- You can FEED, PLAY WITH, or HEAL all your pets at once.
- You can CHANGE which pet you are actively managing.
